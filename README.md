# Bank API


RESTful API for Banking Management developed in Spring.

# Description

In order to build this RESTful API I have used the Spring Framework which made
developing much simpler. As object-relational mapping I used Hibernate with Java
Persistence API. In order to test the REST endpoints before any implementation logic
I have been using Swagger UI which allows me to visualize and interact with the API
resources.
I have applied the REST arhitectural style to the idea of managing a bank. Thus,
making it possible to create accounts, viewing the current balance, transactions and
making payments between different accounts. Of course, the currency in which the
account is created will be also taken into consideration, so when making a transfer the
exchange rate will be made if necessary.
